# CSCE3550-Project2

Used the C++ Project 1 Template code provided with the assignment. For some reason, the Template code that was given returned a score of 1/65 on the gradebot for project 1, and at the time of submission returned a score of 10/65 for project 2. The reason for this is unknown to me. I tried using templates in other languages but got the same result.
