# CSCE3550-Project2

Name: Kyle Youngquist
EUID: khy0011

Used the C++ Project 1 Template code provided with the assignment. For some reason, the Template code that was given initially returned a score of 1/65 on the gradebot for project 1 and 0/65 for project 2. At the time of submission the code returned a score of 10/65 for project 2, as shown in the screenshot. The reason for this is unknown to me. I tried using templates in other languages but got the same result.
